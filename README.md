# Odin Recipes

This is a project for The Odin Projectâ€™s Foundations course. The goal of this project is to build a simple website that contains recipes using basic HTML skills.

## Skills demonstrated:
- Structuring HTML documents
- Working with lists, links, and images
- Using relative and absolute paths
- Creating multi-page websites

By completing this project, I will have gained practical experience with core HTML elements and a better understanding of how to organize content for the web.
